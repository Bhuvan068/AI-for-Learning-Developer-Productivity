## Project Title
AI-Assisted Reasoning-First Learning Companion

## Problem Statement
Despite widespread digital educational content (videos, PDFs, slides), many students—especially in Indian school and undergraduate education—struggle with weak conceptual understanding and poor problem-solving. Learning is largely passive: content does not provide feedback, correct misunderstandings, or require active reasoning.

Existing AI learning tools respond to questions but do not detect misconceptions, enforce reasoning steps, or apply real-world constraints, leaving gaps in transferable understanding.

## Goal
Design an interactive, AI-assisted learning companion that integrates with existing content, actively intervenes during learning, enforces reasoning, identifies misconceptions, and provides guided corrective feedback. 

## Target Users
- School and undergraduate students  
- Teachers (for monitoring and intervention)  
- Institutions adopting digital content  

## Key Features
1. **Reasoning Checkpoints:** Engage students with questions to assess understanding before providing explanations.  
2. **Misconception Detection:** Identify incorrect assumptions and reasoning errors.  
3. **Guided Feedback:** Provide corrective guidance rather than just answers.  
4. **Multilingual Support:** English and Telugu interfaces.  
5. **Low-Bandwidth Optimization:** Accessible in rural or resource-constrained environments.  
6. **Interactive with Content:** Works alongside videos, PDFs, slides; allows highlighting and pausing.  

## Constraints
- AI acts as a guide, not a teacher replacement.  
- No content generation or summarization.  
- Must integrate with existing educational materials.  

## Success Metrics
- Improvement in student reasoning and problem-solving ability.  
- Reduced misconceptions and errors in practice tasks.  
- Adoption in low-bandwidth and multilingual contexts.
